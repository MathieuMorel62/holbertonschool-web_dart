The "Dart - Function" project aims to strengthen programming skills with the Dart language by focusing on functions. This project proposes a series of progressive tasks allowing participants to understand and master the use of functions in Dart, including string manipulation, arithmetic operations, recursion, and the use of internal and external functions.

Each task is designed to address a specific aspect of Dart functions, from the simplest, such as printing a message, to the most complex, such as determining the longest palindrome in a string of characters. By completing this project, participants will develop an in-depth understanding of the structure and capabilities of the functions in Dart, which is essential for any more advanced application.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies and Tools Used

- **Dart**: Main programming language used for this project, chosen for its conciseness and ability to develop robust web and mobile applications.
- **Git**: Used for version control, allowing you to track changes to the source code and collaborate effectively.
- **GitHub**: Project management and code storage platform, facilitating collaboration and task management.

## üìã Prerequisite

- ![ Dart](https://img.shields.io/badge/Dart-2.10-blue)
- ![ Git](https://img.shields.io/badge/Git-2.28.0-red)

## üöÄ Installation and Configuration

1. **Step 1:** Clone the GitHub repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MathieuMorel62/holbertonschool-web_dart.git
```

2. **Step 2:** Move to the directory

```bash
cd 0x01-dart-function
```

3. **Step 3:** Run Dart files

```bash
dart filename.dart
```

## üí° Use

- **Example of use 1:**

To display a personalised welcome message by executing the `hello.dart` file :

```dart
void main() {
print("Hello Mathieu");
}
```

**Execution:**

```bash
dart hello.dart
```

**Expected result:**

```bash
Hello Mathieu
```

## ‚ú® Main Features

1. **Handling of strings**:
The project includes programs that manipulate strings, such as the concatenation of two strings and the display of personalized messages.

3. **Mathematimatical operations**:
Functions to perform addition, subtraction and factor calculation operations recursively.

5. **Assertions and conditions**:
Use of assertions to validate the conditions and ensure that the values meet certain criteria before continuing.

7. **Collection manipulation**:
Conversion of temperature lists from Celsius to Fahrenheit and use of the map method for transformations.

9. **Geometricals**:
Calculation of the area of a triangle from its height and base, with results rounded to two decimal places.
